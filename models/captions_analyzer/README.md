# CaptionsAnalyzer

CaptionsAnalyzer is a Transformer-based model designed to detect and assign captions to their corresponding non-textual elements in documents. The model is based on the DLAFormer (see [DLAFormer: A Transformer-based Approach for Document Layout Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11757)) architecture and has been trained on our in-house dataset.
