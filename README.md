# AnnoPage

AnnoPage is software being developed as part of the [Orbis Pictus project](https://orbis.lib.cas.cz/).

The goal is to create machine-learning–based software that automatically analyzes the content of a digitized page. The system identifies areas of the page that contain non-textual elements, marks these areas, and determines their type (map, illustration, photograph, drawing, table, graph, etc.). The system will then attempt to produce a brief textual description of these areas along with their boundaries (identification of objects using keywords, identification of people, finding and using textual annotations, etc.). This information will be used to supplement standard metadata, which can then be further indexed for search purposes and displayed to users in digital libraries using the Kramerius system, for example through the [Czech Digital Library](https://ceskadigitalniknihovna.cz/).

The development is carried out by the [Orbis Pictus project team](https://orbis.lib.cas.cz/resitelsky-tym/).
